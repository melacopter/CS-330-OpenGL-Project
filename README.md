# CS-330-OpenGL-Project
This repository is dedicated to a project I created as part of a computer graphics course. I used OpenGL to create a 3D scene of some Pusheen figures that I own.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

This project proved to be quite a challenge in the beginning. I have taken a 3D modeling course before, but I have never modeled a scene using just code. OpenGl was a new experience for me, and it forced me to overcome and adapt all the challenges it presented. I used a lot of resources to help me construct this project and build a foundation for the creation of my 3D scene. When building this program, I spent a lot of time analyzing the code and trying to understand how it all worked together. It was like reverse engineering. I would comment out a bit of code and re-run the program to see what changed. As a result, I learned what specific chunks of code did and how to use them in the future. These new tactics can be applied to future projects that I find new and confusing. I now have a way to find out how code works together and what function it serves within a program. 

**How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**

Running programs often in order to test their functionality is a great way to learn and ensure that your end product will work as intended. Additionally, building and implementing new features into a program at weekly intervals creates structure in the development process, which encourages efficiency. I did find myself having to restructure my code a few times to account for new features and functionalities that were presented. Initially, I thought it was inconvenient. However, upon reflection of this project, I think it is an important experience to have. There will be many projects that change and evolve over time, and learning how to adapt quickly is a great skill to have in the professional world. 

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**

As an aspiring data analyst, computer science and all its foundational skills are necessary for my success. Creating a 2D or 3D scene seems unnecessary in my desired field, as there are other libraries that can create a visual representation of data more efficiently than if I were to use OpenGL. However, I am not saying that I don't think that what I learned in this course could be useful. Even if I don't see myself using OpenGL ever again in my life, the soft skills I have developed as part of this project will help me find success in the future. The ability to adapt to changing program requirements and having to learn a completely new concept in the time span of 8 weeks will definitely translate to my professional career.
